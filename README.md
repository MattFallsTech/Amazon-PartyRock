Created my first project by clicking on "Build your own app" and entered a test description  <br/>

<br />
<br />
I added a joke topic and clicked the play button  <br/>

<br />
PartyRock generated a joke and an image  <br/>

<br />
<br />
After testing it out I started completing the task scheduler by entering the description "Generate a daily task scheduler" into a new project   <br/>

<br />
<br />
I added 3 tasks that I would like to be generated and clicked the play button <br/>

<br />
<br />
PartyRock generated task priorities, daily schedule and also even provided me with a chatbot so I can refine my schedule <br/>

<br />
<br />
I am also able to modify the widgets like resizing them and placing them in different locations by clicking edit in the top left <br/>

<br />
<br />
I was also able to edit a specific widget with prompts and model <br/>

<br />
<br />
I then added a new widget to show the approximate time required to complete each task <br/>

<br />
<br />
I changed the prompt to reflect the "time" widget that I added and for it to suggest a schedule based on the tasks and the time required <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now this is updated to reflect the time it would take for each task to be completed <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next I published the application and made it public by clicking on the green arrow in the top right <br/>
