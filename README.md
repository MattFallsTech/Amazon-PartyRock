After testing it out I started on the task scheduler by entering the disctiption "Generate a daily task scheduler" into a new project   <br/>

I was also able to edit a specific widget with prompts and model <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now i added a new widget to show the approximate time required to complete each task <br/>

<br />
<br />
I changed the prompt to reflect the "time" widget that i added and for it to suggest a schedule based on the tasks and the time requied <br/>

<br />
<br />
It now updated to reflect the time it would take for each task to be completed <br/>
